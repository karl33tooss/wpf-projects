# Project Description
This is a desktop program where you can view information about cryptocurrency. Maybe it will improve)
Three different tabs that display:
- information with top cryptocurrencies, the data is updated
- a page where you can view detailed information about cryptocurrency (price, volume, price change in 24 hours, markets where you can buy cryptocurrency, etc.). The search for coins is implemented here.
- a page where you can convert one coin into another
Light/dark themes are present.
The application can be better optimized and implemented, but I haven’t had enough time yet (I have ideas, that’s why I said that I could improve the application)
Enjoy!
